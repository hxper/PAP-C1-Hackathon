WiFi Credentials: It sets up WiFi credentials for the rover to connect to a network.

HTTP Server and Handlers: The code sets up an HTTP server for handling requests. It defines handlers for streaming video, controlling the rover, checking status, and serving the index HTML page.

Stream Handler: This function captures frames from the camera and streams them as multipart JPEG images over HTTP.

Command Handler: It interprets HTTP GET requests to control the rover's movements, flash LED, and adjust motor speeds.

Status Handler: Provides JSON-formatted status information about the camera.

Index HTML Page: Defines the structure and functionality of the web interface, including buttons for controlling the rover's movements, flash LED, and servo motors.

Camera Server Setup: Initializes the camera, configures it, sets up the HTTP server, and starts serving.

Motor, Servo, and Flash Initialization: Initializes PWM channels for motors, servos, and flash LED.

Setup Function: Initializes serial communication, camera, WiFi access point, HTTP server, and various components.

Loop Function: Currently empty as there's no continuous operation defined.
