    <h1>Cosmo Craft üöÄ</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Cosmo Craft! This project was developed during the 10xTechClub Hackathon and is designed to control a Mars rover using an ESP-32 CAM module. Additionally, the project includes an APK file that allows users to control the movement of the rover's camera tilt and slide remotely.
    </p>

<h2>Overview üåå</h2>
<p>Cosmo Craft is a project aimed at exploring the capabilities of remote-controlled rovers for planetary exploration. By utilizing an ESP-32 CAM module, we've created a system that allows users to remotely control a rover's movements and camera functionalities.</p>

 <h2>Features üõ†Ô∏è</h2>
<ul>
        <li><strong>Remote Control:</strong> Users can control the movement of the rover using a mobile application.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera Control:</strong> The APK file enables users to adjust the tilt and slide of the rover's camera, providing a comprehensive view of the surroundings.</li>
        <li><strong>ESP-32 CAM Integration:</strong> The project is built around the ESP-32 CAM module, ensuring reliable wireless communication and high-quality image transmission.</li>
    </ul>

 <h2>How to Use üì≤</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Setup ESP-32 CAM:</strong> Follow the instructions provided with the ESP-32 CAM module to set it up and connect it to your network.</li>
        <li><strong>Install APK:</strong> Install the provided APK file on your mobile device to gain control over the rover's camera movements.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect:</strong> Connect your mobile device to the same network as the ESP-32 CAM module.</li>
        <li><strong>Launch App:</strong> Launch the APK file on your mobile device and start controlling the rover's camera.</li>
        <li><strong>Drive:</strong> Use the controls in the mobile application to maneuver the rover across different terrains.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Dependencies üì¶</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ESP-32 Arduino Library:</strong> Required for programming the ESP-32 CAM module.</li>
        <li><strong>APK File:</strong> Android application for controlling camera movements.</li>
        <li><strong>WiFi Connection:</strong> Ensure that both the rover and the mobile device are connected to the same WiFi network for seamless communication.</li>
    </ul>
